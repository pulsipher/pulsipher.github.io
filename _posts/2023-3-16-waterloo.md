I am pleased to announce that I have accepted a position as a tenure-track assistant professor of [chemical engineering at the University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/chemical-engineering/) in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. This next chapter of my career will begin in July 2023. I am excited to foster new collaborations at UWaterloo with a large collection of individuals that readily complement my core interests in data science, optimization, open-source software, sustainability, and clean energy.

Thank you to all those that have guided and helped me along my academic journey over the last 12+ years! I could not have done it without you all.

Stay tuned for updates on opportunities to join my research group as a graduate student or post-doctoral associate.
