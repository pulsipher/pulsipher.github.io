Interested in developing computational tools to make the world a better place to live? Consider applying to join my group as a master's or PhD student. There are no current postdoc openings. Before applying please review <a href="/research.html">my research page</a> and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQoNMl5UWH8">recent video interview</a> (shown below) to see if my group's research focus is a good fit for you.

I am seeking students with significant interest in mathematics, chemical engineering, and computer programming that are excited about employing these fundamentals to solve real-world decision-making problems. The current search is for students that can start in 2024. Required qualifications include:
- Genuine excitement for the research focus of my group
- A bachelor's degree in *chemical engineering* (or similar) completed no later than summer 2024
- A competitive academic GPA (minimum requirement is an 80% average for every degree)
- High proficiency in English (i.e., 7+ IELTS score (or equivalent) or native speaker)
- Comply with all program requirements set by UWaterloo (please review [the department's graduate program webpage](https://uwaterloo.ca/chemical-engineering/future-graduate-students))

Preferred qualifications include:
- Computational research experience, especially pertaining to optimization and data science
- Strong background in mathematics
- Proficiency with computer programming (e.g., Python, Julia)
- Excellent technical writing ability

Please note that the primary focus of our research group is NOT machine learning, but rather on optimization (i.e., decision-making) techniques which can leverage data-driven models to improve our modeling capabilities for real-world systems.

To apply, please email [pulsipher@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:pulsipher@uwaterloo.ca) with the following information/format:
- Subject line: "Student Application for MASc/PhD Position" (selecting MASc or PhD as appropriate)
- Email body: **Briefly** introduce yourself and summarize why you would like to join my group
- Attachments (PDFs only): CV/resume, academic transcript for each degree, English proficiency test results (if applicable), and a technical writing sample (e.g., an article or report) if available

**Before applying make sure you meet the minimum requirements described above and [those set by UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/chemical-engineering/future-graduate-students).** Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. **Incomplete applications will not be considered.** Every application will be carefully reviewed, please do not send multiple emails. You may not receive a response immediately, but rest assured every application will be reviewed. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this all the way to the end!
