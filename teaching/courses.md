# Introductory Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence for Chemical Engineers
At UWaterloo, I am piloting this introductory course on how to support analysis and modelling using data-driven methods from machine learning and data science.

# Numerical Methods for Numerical Analysis and Design (CHE 322)
At UWaterloo, I teach numerical methods of relevance to chemical engineering. This focuses on how using numerical methods and computers to tackle the solution of systems of equations, ordinary differential equations, and partial differential equations.

# Process Optimization (CHE 521)
At UWaterloo, I teach the fundamentals of mathematical programming for chemical engineers. This course provides an overview of the methods, modelling, theory, and application of optimization approaches in a chemical engineering context.

# Process Control (CHE 341)
At UWaterloo, I teach the fundamentals of process control to chemical engineering undergraduate students. The course uses a hands-on learning experience to help students gain  a practical and theoretical foundation for industrially relevant automation.

# Chemical Process Modeling (CBE 255)
At UW-Madison, I co-instructed this course focusing on the computer programming course material. The course provides an integrative overview of how programming tools like MATLAB and python can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in chemical engineering. By the end of this course, students should be sufficiently familiar with programming to solve challenging numerical problems (e.g., batch reaction kinetics).

# Short Courses on Julia and InfiniteOpt.jl
In this short course, I provide a hands-on introduction to:
- programming in [Julia](https://julialang.org/),
- solving optimization problems via [JuMP.jl](https://jump.dev/), and
- modeling infinite-dimensional optimization problems in [InfiniteOpt.jl](https://infiniteopt.github.io/InfiniteOpt.jl/stable/).

</ul>

The course materials are freely available [here](https://github.com/infiniteopt/InfiniteOptTutorials/tree/main/short_course) on GitHub. By the end of this course, students should be familiar with:
- scripting in Julia,
- solving optimization problems in JuMP.jl and InfiniteOpt.jl,
- and should have the resources they need to learn further.

To date, I have taught this course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Carnegie Mellon University, in Busan, South Korea, the University of Waterloo, in Toronto, Canada, and at the Ohio State University.
