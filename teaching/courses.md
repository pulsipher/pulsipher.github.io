# Process Optimization (CHE 521)
An introduction to chemical process optimization. Model development and classification of optimization problems. Linear programming techniques, simplex algorithm, goal programming and barrier method, parametric sensitivity analysis and duality theory. Convex optimization, necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality for unconstrained and constrained problems. Mixed-integer programming. Trajectory optimization. Applications include optimization of heat exchanger networks, multistage separation processes, batch operations, process scheduling and chemical reactor networks.

# Chemical Process Modeling (CBE 255)
At UW-Madison I co-instructed this course focusing on the computer programming course material. The course provides an integrative overview of how programming tools like MATLAB and python can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in chemical engineering. By the end of this course, students should be sufficiently familiar with programming to solve challenging numerical problems (e.g., batch reaction kinetics).

# Short Courses on Julia and InfiniteOpt.jl
In this short course, I provide a hands-on introduction to:
- programming in [Julia](https://julialang.org/),
- solving optimization problems via [JuMP.jl](https://jump.dev/), and
- modeling infinite-dimensional optimization problems in [InfiniteOpt.jl](https://infiniteopt.github.io/InfiniteOpt.jl/stable/).

</ul>

The course materials are freely available [here](https://github.com/infiniteopt/InfiniteOptTutorials/tree/main/short_course) on GitHub. By the end of this course, students should be familiar with:
- scripting in Julia,
- solving optimization problems in JuMP.jl and InfiniteOpt.jl,
- and should have the resources they need to learn further.

To date, I have taught this course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Carnegie Mellon University, and in Busan, South Korea.

# Short Course on Euler Methods for Batch Reactors
I have put together a short course on introductory numerical methods for simulating batch reactors via Euler methods.
